GMQE (Global Model Quality Estimation) is a quality estimation which combines properties from the targetâ€“template alignment and the template search method. The resulting GMQE score is expressed as a number between 0 and 1, reflecting the expected accuracy of a model built with that alignment and template and the coverage of the target. Higher numbers indicate higher reliability.

QMEAN is a quality estimate. It provides an estimate of the "degree of nativeness" of the structural features observed in the model on a global scale. It indicates whether the QMEAN score of the model is comparable to what one would expect from experimental structures of similar size. QMEAN Z-scores around zero indicate good agreement between the model structure and experimental structures of similar size. Scores of -4.0 or below are an indication of models with low quality.
